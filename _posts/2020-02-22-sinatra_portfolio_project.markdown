Since I'm out traveling for an extremely important family matter, I decided to revolve my project around something like a daily journal or diary. For this project, I decided to do something simple and create a Travel CRUD app where the user can keep track of their destinations, the dates, and add some notes or a small journal about it. A user fills out the destination, date, content and has the ability to: sign up, log in, CRUD their destinations, see all their destinations, and see their page. They won't be able to edit other users' pages and I attempted to use bcrypt to secure their password, as well as make sure the user is who they say they are. I wanted to make it as simple as I can so that I will get the understanding that Flatiron school expects of me. When I'm a little more comfortable, I'll definitely dive into it more. 

As with the first project, watching instructors create a project from start to finish, reading other projects and such has been the biggest help. In starting the project, I think it's best for me to start from the outside in, which includes the overview of the project and what I want it to do, working on the models and the database, then the views and controllers. I kept running into bugs and breaking my project but as long as I submit somethng that works at this time, I'll be happy. I will try to be more independent in creating my next one, and attempt to stop "piggybacking" or using the training wheels provided by Flatiron School, since I know if we become web developers in the future then we're on our own, per se. 

Overall this was an awesome experience creating a simple Sinatra CRUD app, and I will definitely try to enhance this project after submission to advance my understanding behind it. Unfortunately there's a major personal issue going on with my family, so it's been tough to just sit down and focus on the curriculum. But it only made me more motivated to do better, especially when I get back home. The only thing worrying me at this stage in the curriculum is I have so much to learn in software engineering, and getting stuck can be a major letdown. But, I see that I am making progress in my goal to learn software engineering.
