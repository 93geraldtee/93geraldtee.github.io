It was said that the first blog should be personal, so I'll be real.

For a while now, I’ve struggled with direction in life and had a million interests. That's great for hobbies but career-wise, it doesn’t help. I’ve had jobs working in kitchens, doing photoshoots, taught guitar a couple times… but couldn't picture myself making a lucrative career with any of this. I was always badgered by my family to get into healthcare, so I reluctantly decided to pursue that field because there’s good jobs in it and I didn’t know what else to do. Going into tech was an option, but I thought I didn't have the brains for that. Maybe confidence was the issue. Instead of looking inward and exploring computer science or other paths, I let my family lead and was out to please them.

Fast forward to college in 2011, I went in as a Biology major and started failing classes (bad priorities). In 2017, I graduated with high honors in Exercise Science (after transferring and switching majors a couple times) as a stepping-stone degree for other healthcare professions, and went straight to an Accelerated Nursing Program in California. This proved that one could achieve things if they worked for it, yet, I constantly had a gut feeling that this wasn’t right and I was incredibly unhappy with that path. After a few months, I withdrew from nursing school and this year I went back to NJ, feeling like I've failed. So much has happened this year, but I guess that's how life works.

Now I had to decide what to do, and looking at what interests me and impacts my life the most, it all pinpoints to technology. Why not have a career related to that? I've always wanted to create my own website or app, so why not work in that field? We all know software development is rewarding in more ways than one, and as I did more research, I decided that this is the perfect time to take a shot at it. That’s when I discovered more about bootcamps and Flatiron School. Their message, the talks by [Avi Flombaum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9DJn5EMtZQ) and success stories are inspiring, so maybe it's not as out of my league as I thought it was.

Then I was accepted! I’m grateful, but this is probably the hardest thing I’ve tried to learn. Like many other students, I have zero coding background. Programming isn’t like the sciences, it’s fun but at times I have no clue what I’m doing, and some of these labs make me think I’m not cut out for it. I try to remind myself that anyone who got good at anything worked hard, put in the hours and stuck with it. Whatever happens, like [Avi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9DJn5EMtZQ) said, if I keep pushing then at some point, I’ll get there and it’ll all work out. No matter how cliché, it's motivating to hear this said not only for coding, but for life in general.
