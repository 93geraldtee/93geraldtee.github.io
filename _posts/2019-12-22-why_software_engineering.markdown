For a while I’ve struggled with direction and have many interests. I’ve had jobs working in kitchens, doing photoshoots, taught guitar… but couldn't picture myself making a lucrative career. I was convinced by my family to go into healthcare, so I reluctantly decided to pursue that field because there’s good jobs and I didn’t know what else to do. Studying in the technology fields was always an option, but I thought that it was out of my reach to learn and went with what others told me.

Fast forward to college in 2011, I went in as a Biology major. I switched majors arounds and in 2017, graduated with high honors in Exercise Science and went straight to an Accelerated Nursing Program in California. I felt proud of myself for achieving honors and learned I could achieve my goal if I worked for it, yet, I constantly had a gut feeling that this wasn’t right and I was incredibly unhappy with that path. After a few months, I withdrew from nursing school and went back to NJ a couple months ago, feeling like I've failed. So much has happened this year, but I guess that's how life works!

Now I had to decide what to do, and looking at what interests me and impacts my life the most, it all pinpoints to technology. We all know software development is rewarding in more ways than one, and as I did more research, I decided that this is the perfect time to learn. That’s when I discovered more about bootcamps and Flatiron School. Their message, the talks by [Avi Flombaum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9DJn5EMtZQ) and success stories are inspiring, so maybe it's not as out of reach as I thought it was.

Then I was accepted! I’m grateful, but this is one of the hardest thing I’ve tried to learn. Like many other students, I have zero coding background. Programming isn’t like the sciences, it’s fun but at times I have no clue what I’m doing, and some of these labs make me think I’m not cut out for it. I try to remind myself that anyone who got good at anything worked hard, put in the hours and stuck with it. Whatever happens, like [Avi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9DJn5EMtZQ) said, if I keep pushing then at some point, I’ll get there and it’ll all work out. It may be a cliché, but it's motivating to hear this said not only for coding, but for life in general.
