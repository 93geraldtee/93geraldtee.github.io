I definitely learned a lot with this project. I pulled my data from a Breaking Bad API that listed all the characters and their details. After I submit this project I definitely want to go back and work on adding more features so I can learn more, and maybe try scraping instead.

Before I started there were the lessons on object-oriented programming, and it was very difficult to grasp a real understanding of it. I was behind in the pacing but powered through and did what I could. When the first project week came up, I was stumped as I had no idea where or how to begin. Thankfully, our instructors walked us through on how to create a simple CLI application so I used their guides as a blueprint. In the lectures, I was a bit worried because I haven't caught up in the lessons and it felt like they were going a bit fast. 

In project week, I tried to catch up as fast I could, and started after looking over Music Library CLI. Like I said I was stumped. I first had to watch over all the lectures including Daily Deal, and all supplemental ones I could find related to the project. I watched maybe 3 or 4 different instructors start, and had to dissect the videos and code alongside them. I started piecing together info bit by bit, looking over each line of code, going back to the videos and googling until it started making more sense to me. I can be honest to say I still don't have a 100% grasp, and I need to watch the videos, go back on previous lessons and do them over.

I think the biggest challenge with the project was the syntax and the actual code. As I caught up with the lectures and videos, I could understand the bigger picture such as writing the overview of my project, what I want my application to do and breaking it down to start to code, but once I get to coding, the syntax, logic, etc., it all gets very confusing and I definitely overcomplicate things. I was constantly switching between google and the videos. When I got my project working, and I saw that I was interacting with a the CLI, it felt great and I thought "wow, this is so cool." However, I realized that some methods and code that I got elsewhere I didn't fully understand even if it made my program work, such as the  `.send()` and `.respond_to?()` methods. I'm definitely going back to review as much as I can. 

Overall I can definitely see why they call it a bootcamp, this is meant to be tough and condensed in a short time. Without Flatiron School and support from the cohort I definitely wouldn't have made it this far learning to code. I can't believe I made a CLI application, no matter how simlpe it is and even if I don't fully understand everything, I feel proud that I got this far.
